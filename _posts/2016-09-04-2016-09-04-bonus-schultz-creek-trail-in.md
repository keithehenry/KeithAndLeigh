We drove up to Flagstaff for an approximate 12 F temperature drop and
tried the Schultz Creek Trail.

The air was cool with a gentle breeze and
the sky was crisp clear blue. The pine forest with granite boulders
reminded us easily of hiking in PA and NH.
With only a gentle grade it
wasn't strenuous, but at 7500 ft, it was still slow going.  
  
The trail is very popular with mountain bikers sometimes riding downhill
at a pretty fast clip. Parts of the trail also have some road noise from
the nearby scenic Schultz Pass Rd. Several other trails are accessible
from the spacious parking lot, so there are plenty of options to try
another day.
