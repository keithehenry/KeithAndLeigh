We got out fairly early and drove to the parking area off Jacks Canyon
Rd.

Although we enjoyed exploring this trail again, and going further
than before, it was a bit long and rocky for the payoff. Still, the
views looking down the canyon were quite nice.  
A hearty invigorating
hike was had by all (with overcast skies and 45 F temperatures).
