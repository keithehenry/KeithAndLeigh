We hit the jackpot on this one!

It was a super day, although we wished we had our windbreakers for part
of the time. The hike up Brins Mesa was pleasant in its own right, as it
was a wide trail and nicely wooded. Eventually, before getting to the
mesa, it does get a bit steep and rocky. Once up to the top though, it
is as flat as can be for great long-distance views.

The right-hand turn to the unmarked trail to the Mormon Canyon Overlook
is just as you reach the mesa. There is some additional elevation gain
but it's gentle. The spectacular views don't really become apparent
until the trail ends at the edge of the deep canyon below. The views
here are terrific. \[The blog's panorama is from this vantage point.\]
