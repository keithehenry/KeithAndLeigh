The White Mountains' Basin-Cascade Trail is lovely.

We had been to The Basin, right off the highway on I-93 several times over the years, but this is the first time we ventured further along the Basin-Cascade Trail. It was outstanding, with several beautiful places to picnic, rest, and enjoy the lovely cascading water.

Here's the iconic The Basin:

And our beautiful brunch spot:

This hike was easy to moderate with about 400 ft of elevation gain. The roots and rocks in the White Mountains make all the trails a bit more challenging then we're used to. It was less than two miles round-trip but with all the beautiful views and places to rest we were able to enjoy about three hours there total.

Here's the short highlights video. Enjoy!
