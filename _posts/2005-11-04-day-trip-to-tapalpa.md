We finally got off the computers, out of the house, and onto the open
road for a day trip to Tapalpa yesterday.

Tapalpa is a quaint mountain town popular with tourists and families
from Guadalajara. It was about a three hour drive from home. Much of the
fun was winding through the mountain roads and enjoying the great views
along the way.

We were quite hungry by the time we arrived. The first order of business
was finding something to eat. We both had the meal of the day, *chiles
relleno*, at a small restaurant. It wasn't gourmet but very satisfying.

We browsed around the shops. It was a weekday so many weren't open. We
were the only two customers, enjoying coffee and cake, at an Internet cafe.

The town square was very pleasant.

We wandered around a bit more and found a motel, *La Casa de Maty*. We
saw the inside of one of the rooms and it looked nice.

It was a long exhausting day by the time we arrived back home. The
winding roads combined with the elevation change can make ones head
ache. It was great fun though. We'll go back again and stay overnight
next time.
