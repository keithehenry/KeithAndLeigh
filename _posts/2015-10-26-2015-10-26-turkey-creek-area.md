Cobre and I explored the Turkey Creek area for his morning walk.

We parked at a small lot off Verde Valley School Rd. Then we checked out
the condition of Turkey Creek Rd on foot. Looks fine to drive with
probably only one tricky spot. At Turkey Creek Trail proper, the sign
indicated that it was about three miles one way, and usually pretty hot
in Summer. We decided against going any further. Heading back, we
noticed a path leading off from the upper parking lot in the general
direction of the car. We followed it; got a little lost at one point. I
was glad to have my newfangled GPS app to get headed back in the right
direction. Eventually, we found a trail that lead right back to the
car.
