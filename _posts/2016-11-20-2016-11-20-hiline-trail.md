Several friends recently mentioned the Hiline Trail so we decided today
was a good day to try it.

We parked at the Yavapai Vista parking lot and joined Hiline via Kaibab,
Yavapai, and a short section of Slim Shady. There are a few hundred feet
of elevation gain at the start then it levels off as one walks along the
ridge. There are great views at several points overlooking much of the
terrain between the Village of Oak Creek and Sedona proper. Of course,
the main attraction are the views towards Cathedral Rock. The trail is
narrow and a bit more challenging than average but not difficult. We
only set out for a "quick morning walk" so only went about 2 miles total
but thoroughly enjoyed this new vantage point.
