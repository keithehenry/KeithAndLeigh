We just returned from a quick three night exploration of
Pinetop-Lakeside, AZ.

Pinetop-Lakeside, two towns now merged into one, is a popular summer
retreat in the White Mountains of Arizona (east central) at an elevation
of 6,804â€². It's pretty - pines, mountains, lakes, and more pines.

We were mostly just trying to get the feel for the place but did look at
a few rentals and cabins for sale. There are a lot available, especially
FSBOs this time of year. The area has a friendly small town feel but
there are plenty of services available too. We could easily live there
for several months or year round even.

It's not as pretty as Sedona, but it's nice. *And cooler!*

Here's a pretty nice [Pinetop-Lakeside](https://photos.app.goo.gl/BZjUplYMMkp50Y4m1) photo album.
(Some are short videos.)

For entertainment, I played around with Google Photos movies. Don't
worry, they're short.
