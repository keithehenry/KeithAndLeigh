The new home for everything *KeithAndLeigh.com* :wink: .

It started as an experiment in free hosting
with Github Pages and Jekyll. It's turned into our new
website!

The effort so far has been to revamp several old sad broken blogs,
originally hosted at Blogger, repair all the broken links, and
enjoy strolling back through memory lane.
These blogs include
[Mexico](./categories/mexblog),
[Casa de](./categories/casa), and now
[Hikes](./categories/hikes).

More recent adventures are simply accessed via the [Home](.) page.

An index to some of our favorite online [Photo Albums](./albums)
has been started as well. Enjoy!
