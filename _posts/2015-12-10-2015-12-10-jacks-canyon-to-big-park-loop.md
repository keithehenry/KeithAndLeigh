A super day to get out and get a quick fix of fresh air and Sedona red
rock scenery.

We parked at the same spot as our last hike, off Jack's
Canyon Road, but walked in the opposite direction and joined up with the
Big Park Loop trail, then turned back.

(GPS cut out so the hike might be a bit longer then indicated.)
