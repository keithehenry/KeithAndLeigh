This is mostly an experiment in 
free hosting at Github
with Jekyll and Github Pages.

The effort so far has been to revamp several old sad broken blogs,
originally hosted at Blogger, repair all the broken links, and
enjoy strolling back along memory lane.
These blogs include
[Mexico Blog](./categories/mexblog), and
[Casa de](./categories/casa).

I've also started to integrate a few of our more recent adventures
from other postings or email correspondence. These are simply the
more recent entries on the [Home](.) page.

My intention is to add an index to some of our favorite online
photo albums next.
