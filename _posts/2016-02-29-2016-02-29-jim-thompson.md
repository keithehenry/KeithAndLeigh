We chose the Jim Thompson trail for our leap-day hike.

Jim Thompson is accessible from the same trailhead as Brin's Mesa, otherwise we knew
very little about it. Cobre had had some recent injuries so we didn't
want to push it too hard, and didn't know how far we'd get.  
  
It was a fine hike. It was more popular than we expected. We did catch
some good views and Cobre made it back without aggravating his arthritis
or injuries. If we had pushed on we might have eventually been able to
see Midgley Bridge.  
  
Next time, we'll probably start on Jim Thompson from the bridge side and
get to walk its length that way.
