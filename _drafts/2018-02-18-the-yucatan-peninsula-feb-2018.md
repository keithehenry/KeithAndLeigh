Our Yucatán Peninsula adventure was a complete success.

In late December, we decided to treat ourselves to a travel adventure,
in honor of Leigh's birthday, in February. We wanted something fun, but
easy, involving water, and especially the beach. As Road Scholar now
sends us several mailing a month, we easily found
[this](https://www.roadscholar.org/find-an-adventure/21189/yucatan-peninsula-adventure-hike-snorkel-and-bike-the-land-of-the-maya)
*Yucatan Peninsula Adventure: Hike, Snorkel and Bike the Land of the
Maya* tour which fit the requirements nicely. (See [my saved
version](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MwkHB9wLnr55TTG2pJIHyROU-8DXmVQT)
if required / preferred.)

However... Keith had been planning to charge the next big trip to a new
Citi AAdvantage credit card to earn Leigh 60K American Airline miles for
free, as he had done the previous year. We quickly applied for the card,
waited a week for it to arrive, and... darn it! The Road Scholar trip
had filled up and was no longer available. Bummer! But wait a minute...
That was a lot of money for only six full days not including airfare.
And we would like more time on the beach and to see the ruins in Uxmal
and besides, we already get the Mexican culture and speak Spanish (sort
of) so why not just plan the trip ourselves?
