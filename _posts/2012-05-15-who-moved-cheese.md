I've been reminded recently of the tiny book/pamphlet, *Who Moved My
Cheese?,* that I read before moving from my pleasant little town in the
USA to the Lake Chapala area in Mexico.

Unfortunately, the cheese seems to be getting stale *here* lately,
albeit for a very different reason.

No, I'm not very happy. My little community near Lake Chapala was
mentioned on the PBS Newshour last night - not a good sign.

A more [detailed story](https://theguadalajarareporter.net/index.php/news/news/lake-chapala/31031-lakeside-kidnap-victims-among-dead-in-may-9-massacre) of
the tragedy in our community can be found in a English language
newspaper, The Guadalajara Report. The end of this article even mentions
my tiny little village of San Nicolás de Ibarra where I sometimes walk
with the dog or buy *tamales* to enjoy a pleasant Saturday morning.

A [follow up story](
https://theguadalajarareporter.net/index.php/news/news/regional/31067-six-arrested-over-kidnappings-linked-to-chapala-massacre)
offers both a glimmer of hope, that law enforcement is up to
the challenge, as well as pretty scary details about the raid in sleepy
little San Nicolás.

Who the hell moved the cheese?
