The old stove used to sit on a platform in an awkward location in the
middle of the kitchen. We had the platform removed and the gas pipe
relocated to one of the walls.

Here's a photo of the work in progress on October 17:

This finally set us in motion to look for tile to fill the newly created
hole. The same old tiles are no longer made. Eventually, we settled on
some rich-looking dark red tiles available at one of the stores right
here in Chapala. We also decided to expand the area from a 6x3 to a 6x5
to may it look more purposefully centered in the room.

Here they are the day after being installed:

We like them and expect them to match a bit better once the old grout is
acid washed and sealed.
