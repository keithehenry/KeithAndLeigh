Yes we are fine. We probably won't have Internet service at home for
another week so our ability to communicate is limited. We're meeting up
for haircuts in 15 minutes so we'll see how that goes. We have been busy
just getting settled in. The rental house needed a lot of cleaning,
maintenance, etc. It hadn't been rented for quite a while. We're able to
make breakfast and warm up left-overs but not much else yet. Eating out
is great but not every night.

We miss you guys.

I'll write more next week. Hopefully I'll have DSL Internet by then.
