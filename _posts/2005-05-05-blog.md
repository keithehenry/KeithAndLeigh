We are doing very well, but having a difficult time keeping up with all
our friends and family in the States. We are currently working on an
internet "Blog" which will tell some of our tales of the last seven
months. We found we have written emails to a few people consistently and
that a lot of the information could be shared with a larger circle of
friends and that could save a lot of time.

You'd think time is something we'd have plenty of, but the days have a
rhythm all their own and we are very busy! Sometimes we are just busy
resting in the heat of the day...but busy none-the-less! I'll send you
the information about our blog when it's ready.
