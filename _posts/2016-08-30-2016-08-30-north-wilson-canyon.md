The deck was stacked against us this morning.

We got out late, 10AM. My hydration pack was wet from overfilling but
off we went. We'd always seen lots of cars at Indian Gardens so we
planned to hike whatever trail left from the parking lot. Strange. It
turns out you can buy Red Rock passes there but there aren't any trails.
I found that my pack wasn't just wet, it was leaking. I fixed it but had
lost a lot of water. It's getting hot.  
  
We pushed up the road just a little further to the parking area for
North Wilson Canyon Trail. Oh No! Leigh's hydration pack hadn't been
sealed properly either and she barely had any water left at all. Even
though we're up canyon, it's pretty hot.  
  
I wanted to see what the trail was like anyway. So we hiked up just a
short ways, maybe fifteen minutes. We'll do it again another day when
it's cooler and we have our full supply of water.  
  
For as far as we got, this panorama is not bad though:

We ended up having a splendid time afterwards though, enjoying our lunch
and Oak Creek access at the Bootlegger Picnic Area.
