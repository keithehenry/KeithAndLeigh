In search of cooler temps, or at least a few lakes and rivers, Leigh and
I, Cobre, and Bella hit the road.

[AirBnb](http://www.airbnb.com/) is a fairly good option for us when
traveling with the pets. We scheduled in advance, but juggled
reservations as our needs changed. We tend to be more interested in good
value and flexibility then luxury, and a few listing fit the bill.

We started our trip with one night at the [Well appointed
rambler](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17344014) outside of Salt Lake
City, UT. It was just OK - low ceilings and evaporative cooling. We
happened to arrive on July 22, Pioneer Day. The fireworks spooked Cobre
as he was trying to relieve himself. Not the best introduction to the
neighborhood.

Pushing forward, we arrived at the [Farm
house](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19642596) in Spokane, WA, the
following evening. We had it booked for three weeks.
