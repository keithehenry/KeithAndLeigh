We did it. We went camping for the first time in over 20 years!

I bought a tent over a year ago, but never got around to using it. Now with a new dog, we needed more cargo space in the Renegade, so I bought a Roof Bag this spring. Spring slipped away into summer when a good opportunity to camp in Colorado arose.

I reserved a site at Alvarado Campground, at 9000 ft., outside of Westcliffe, CO., for three nights. It was a long one-day drive. We arrived at dusk, but was able to set up the tent in the dark alright. I had practiced indoors at home twice. :blush:

Here's our campsite the next day, after coffee (but before finishing staking out the tent):

The most *exciting* part of the trip was when, after charging Leigh's smartphone, without the car running, the accessories and light wouldn't turn off, the car wouldn't start, and error messages flashed on the screen. *Nothing worked!* Somehow I remembered that the negative terminal of the battery could be disconnected without tools. I did that, let it sit for a minute, and tried to start the car. As soon as I did, every warning message imaginable flashed on the screen, from coolant too hot, to transmission needs servicing, to trunk being ajar, etc. etc. And once again, nothing worked, but disconnecting the negative. Given the problems I've had with this car's computer in the past, I was afraid we'd have to be towed, from the middle of nowhere, to some town in the middle of nowhere. This happened at dusk, after an otherwise perfect day. We went to bed with it unresolved, and worried about what tomorrow might bring.

The next morning, we both had the idea that maybe holding the ignition switch in for twenty seconds, as one might do for a phone or computer, might work. Nope. Trying to start it just resulted in the flood of error messages again. 

With no other options, asking a neighbor if he could attempt a jump start was the only remaining option. After all, we had been draining the battery, even a little the night before, using the headlights to set up camp. We sure hoped this would work. *But all those error messages were so strange!*

A friendly neighbor with a truck had jumper cables and agreed to help, as soon as his daughter got out of bed. That was a long few hours wait. But all went well. The car started without incident and shows no signs of problems. *Whew!* Note to self: Car batteries are designed for starting the car. *Do not leave the accessories on unattended!*
