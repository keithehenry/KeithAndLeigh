We requested a new telephone line from Telmex in early February.

This house never had telephone service. There are stories of how it can
take years to get a new line. For our neighborhood, we were told to
expect about a four week wait.

I spent a great deal of time in the house and up on the roof identifying
where all the conduits run. Those orange hoses (in the picture below)
are the electrical conduits. Most of the unused ones still have the pull
wire (the galvanized wire) in place from the initial construction.

Here's a photo of the telephone cable pulled through from the roof, into
the television room, and onward into the hall below:

Although Telmex had dropped the line to the house in early March, it
didn't work at first. They finally got the kinks worked out about three
weeks later.
