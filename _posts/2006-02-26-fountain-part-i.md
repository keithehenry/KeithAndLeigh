Martin has a special interest in repairing the fountain near our front
door.

I had bought a pump at Home Depot and got it to work only to find that
the fountain leaked like a sieve. Upon closer inspection it is clear
that it had been roughed-in but never finish.

Here are a couple photos of us (OK, Martin) sealing the bottom. The
sides still leak and remain a project for another day.
