Most mornings, whenever possible, Cobre and I take a walk up the
mountain behind our home. I find it to be very enjoyable and today
decided to share a few photos.

It starts with a great view, just through the gate and around the first
bend:

The gentle uphill climb from this point takes about ten or fifteen
minutes and reminds me of the logging roads around the old hunting camp.
We occasionally see a few men on horseback, but we usually have the
trail all to ourselves.

At the top there's a small pond where I stand and do stretching
exercises. It's been particularly nice lately to see a family of ducks
in residence, and yesterday there were two horses too. Today I brought
the camera and got a similarly good photo of my cow friends instead:

After a few minutes if I'm still not done enjoying the tranquility,
Cobre and I walk over to the shade tree, take a seat, and contemplate
life for a while:

Eventually, we work our way back down to civilization. The whole routine
takes about forty-five minutes. What a great way to start the day. I
love it!
