This is a revamped version of an old blog originally hosted at Blogger.com.

The Blogger version was sad, with half the photos missing and links broken.
Using a combination of Blogger export, Google takeout, Jekyll import, Pandoc, and custom shell scripts,
I managed to extract the essence and recreate the blog here.
