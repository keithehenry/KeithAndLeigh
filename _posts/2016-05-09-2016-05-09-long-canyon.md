It was a beautiful Spring day for our first time on the Long Canyon
trail.

The temperature was cool and the air fresh after a few days of
intermittent showers. There is one stretch that is a bit dull, but
overall it's a great hike - lots of wooded areas opening up to great
views. We had a nice breeze much of the time. Very pleasant.
