Keith spends hours and hours tracing each wire from the electrical panel
to see where it goes. Like most of the houses that haven't been updated,
the electrical wiring leaves a lot to be desired.

There was a blatant error in the TV room that surprisingly was never
fixed. I find all the wires behind the recessed lighting and correct the
reversed power and neutral wires.

What a mess, eh? Unfortunately, they are all like that. (Well, I added
the screw caps and the white tape labels.)
