I've started working, ever so slightly, on the landscaping. The main
landscaping feature of the back yard is the wishing well.

Here is a photo of it about half-way towards its initial clean-up. I
used glyphosate on the left half prior to vacation. Earlier this week, I
removed the debris and added grass clippings as mulch.

I plan to transplant some of the geraniums, that are scattered about
growing in the shade, to this area and see if I can coax them into
blooming. It's a little shady in the morning but gets sun the rest of
the day.
