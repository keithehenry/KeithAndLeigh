We really enjoyed our visit to Pátzcuaro. It was especially fun to go
with our friends Barb, from North of the border, and Debbie and Brad,
from Lakeside.

*\[KEH 2020-08-23\] I made this video many years ago and nearly forgot about it:*

*The video supercedes the [Best of Pátzcuaro](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5uqjJ2EchcXfhrma8)
photo album. But the album photos have captions, if you can find them.
(Try viewing one at a time and moving the mouse a little.
Keyboard arrow keys allow you to go at your own pace.)*

Enjoy!
