Thursday was the big day. We bought a house.

We first called the number in Guadalajara on the for-sale-by-owner sign
in late August. I was anxious about speaking Spanish on the telephone,
but I knew the phrases: *casa*, *se vende*, and *cuanto cuesta*.
That would be enough to get started...

We saw the house that Saturday. As we guessed, it needed some TLC. It
had never been lived in full time, and showed it. It had been owned by
the couple's grandfather (Don Manuel) who had passed away. It was
fifteen years old and needed a whole new kitchen and other renovations
and improvements - a bit of a fixer-upper. But, it had a good feel to
it.

Although we had been occasionally looking at real estate, I had
convinced myself not to buy - at least to wait until the bubble burst in
the United States. Prices would be better then. But renting long term
had its problems too. We had just recently gone back through the rental
market - there wasn't much of interest in our price range. And there's
always the lack of control. I couldn't feel comfortable moving our
things down until either buying, or locking in a very long term
rental.

But with this house we overcame our hesitancy to buy. Basically, the
price was right. We wouldn't lose too much if prices decline, and in the
long run it should be cheaper than renting. At least that was the plan.
It seemed big enough for all our stuff (about 2800 sq. ft.), and we knew
we liked the neighborhood.

We communicated via email in English. My contact would then pass the
information along to his aunts and grandmother. He joked about them all
having different opinions. Before long, they arrived at their lowest
price. Our choice seemed to be to either act at this price or play a
waiting game, hoping that a couple months might bring a new lowest
price. We decided to have a building inspector come see it. He thought
it was very well built by local standards. And his estimate of the cost
of the repairs was in line with our guesses. That pretty much clinched
the decision.

The legalities of executing the transaction are very different than in
the US. There are lots of interesting details, but I'll summarize by
saying everything went quite smoothly. The most surprising thing was
that we never signed or paid anything until about a week before the
closing - and even that was to the government, not the seller or
Notario. That gave us some concern the whole while that something might
go wrong or that they'd get a better offer. But in the end everything
was quite proper.

The process concluded on Thursday with us having the highest regard for
everyone we worked with: the seller's family, the Notario, his office
manager. Everyone dealt with us with respect and professionalism. It was
a very positive experience.

And finally, here are photos of the front and back of our project:
