We watched the first couple SOX games (Leigh is the sport fan these
days) and then she left for Vegas. The next thing I hear is that they
won the last four. I missed them. Did I hear that the world series
starts tonight? We can get the games (sometimes the Patriots too) but
the commentary is in Spanish so it's not quite as fun. We have a
solution for the NFL games (an Internet subscription at NFL.com) that we
are going to try.

I'm still planning on posting the FAQ but of course it is never
"finished", but always a work in progress. I'll let you know when it
debuts.

Maybe when Leigh gets back we will get serious about planning the trip
down in the car. There hasn't been any sense of urgency and we seem to
be only able to take one step at a time. The weather is so nice here
(and always the same) that we forget that it is getting colder up north
and snow season is coming.

I have an Instant Messenger service up and running and used it some
yesterday. It was fun. I'll include info on it in the FAQ as well in
case you want to try it.

Gotta do my Spanish then get out of the house...
