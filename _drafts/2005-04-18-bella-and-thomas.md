The kitties are doing well and have adjusted to their new home
splendidly. No more tummy troubles for Bella now that she eats a very
expensive cat food! Of course, Thomas has to eat it too. They have their
routines and Thomas is our alarm clock to ensure we do not oversleep. He
is pretty consistent with his wake-up time and has adjusted to the
time-change quite well.
