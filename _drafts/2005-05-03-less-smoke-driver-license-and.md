We've been fine. The new rental house is pretty stable now. The terrace
isn't quite done but may never be - it's quite usable though. The
weather has been a bit warm. We have been a bit uncomfortable with a lot
of smoke in the air. There was a large forest fire in an area west of
Guadalajara that shut schools down there for a couple days. Some of the
pollution reached our region. Then there is a lot of local burning as
the indigenous people burn the top of the mountains in preparation for
growing corn. There were some other fires locally that lasted longer
than they normally would because not all the fire trucks were running.
Today is noticeably clearer though so the worst is probably behind us.

I was able to renew my driver's license online without much difficulty.
Looks like we can do it indefinitely even if we don't actually live in
Massachusetts. Every ten years we'll have to come up for a new photo.
Our license will still have our old address but our mailing address can
be anywhere. The RMV website lists an old license as basically the only
requirement for a license renewal. You only actual have to have Mass
residency to get the original learner's permit or original license.
Interesting...

We have decided to go to Yellowstone National Park the end of May (so I
can be out of the country by June 5th when my tourist visa expires).
Although it might be a touch early for the park, which is best in the
summer, we will miss the crowds that start around June 15th. We are
hoping for a great trip. We plan to buy the tickets online today!

That's about it for now. Keep in touch.
