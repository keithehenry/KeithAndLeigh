I have a new favorite hike.



After Cobre was attacked by a neighborhood dog on the
[walk]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url

%})
up to the pond, we started going out in a new direction. Over a period
of months, we eventually found the roads, paths, and trails that lead to
the cross high above San Nicol치s. Today, we went all the way to the top
for the third time - and this time I took the camera. (Unfortunately, it
wasn't a clear day like on one of our earlier treks - but it will give
you the feel nevertheless.)

I sometimes call it a mountain, probably because I know the word in
Spanish (monta침a), but to my friends who recently climbed Mt. Monadnock,
or who hike around Switzerland nearly every year, I'll admit it's really
just a hill. Here it is in the distance as we begin our hike:

On a clear day you can see the cross clearly, often shining in the
sunlight, from the main road along San Nicol치s. But we're a little close
today and the angle isn't very good. With the camera on maximum zoom and
resolution, you can just see the cross on top:

There is a nice resting spot at the base of the hill. On a typical
morning, we only go about this far:

There are great views along the way. That's Vista del Lago in the
distance:

Just as the path opens up to the clearing on the summit, there are a few
large rocks with religious inscriptions:

Finally... Success!
(For the curious, that's a shrine of sorts to the right.)

Facing in the opposite direction, you can see that the cross is aligned
directly with the main street of San Nicol치s:

Here's the view looking off the opposite side. Even on a hazy day, the
views are pretty spectacular:

Finally, I just have to throw in a photo of my hiking companion,
enjoying our accomplishment:

Today, even with the photos and a light snack, it took us only a little
over three hours start to finish.

What great fun!
