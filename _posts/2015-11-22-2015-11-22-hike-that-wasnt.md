We went in search of a trail known as the Mayan Maiden but couldn't find
it.

We ended up back on the Baldwin loop, which we had just done a
couple weeks before, but it was hot, and besides, it was Sunday and
Denver was playing :). We turned around and enjoyed our sandwich wraps
at home - but with chips and salsa!
