We had a delightful visit with Barb before and over the week of American
Thanksgiving.

Barb first got to enjoy some of the usual sights and sounds of Chapala
and a quick stop into one of our favorite little villages, San Antonio.
Then it was off on a four-day excursion to the colonial city of
Patzcuaro. (We had originally planned a trip to the beach, but tropical
storm Sergio put a damper on that so we headed inland instead.) Then it
was back home for a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner at the La
Nueva Posada hotel and afterwards, a walk around Ajijic. On Friday we
went into Guadalajara to run some errands and tour the city center.

As you can tell from my description, the time just flew by...

Here's Barb and Leigh at one of the plazas in Patzcuaro:
