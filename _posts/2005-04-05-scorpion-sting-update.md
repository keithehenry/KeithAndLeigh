We did have one mishap last week...I was stung by a scorpion in our new
house. I'm o.k. but it's not an experience I would like to repeat! It's
got me just a little jumpy and paranoid about my surroundings. The
gardener sprayed outside around the house on Saturday and hopefully that
will keep them out. I'm not so sure though...

There are precautions we can take and you bet we are now taking them!
You are not supposed to leave any clothing or bedding on the floor and
it is recommended that you shake out everything you can. That would have
helped me, as the scorpion was in my denim shorts (which had been on the
floor overnight) and the scorpion was not happy when I put them on.

It took quite a few minutes for him to sting and then awhile for me to
recognize that I had been stung. When Keith suggested maybe what I was
feeling on the back of my leg was a scorpion sting, I came flying out of
my shorts and sure enough, the scorpion came flying out too! We have
workmen here working on our terrace, luckily I was in my office instead
of the room overlooking the terrace when I flew out of my shorts! It
wouldn't have mattered to me who was watching - I didn't think that far
ahead. Luckily we were all saved any embarrassment!

In hindsight I should have gone to a local clinic or the Red Cross for a
shot of antihistamine or perhaps anti-venom, instead of treating myself
at home. I've had an allergic-type reaction with hives and severe
itching for a week now and I wonder if it could have been lessened with
treatment. If there is a next time, I will know.
