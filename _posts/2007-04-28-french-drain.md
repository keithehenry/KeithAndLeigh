We had some water problems in the lower level. So we had Chuy put in a
French drain around the TV room. He did one heck of a job! Indeed, we
haven't had any problems since.

\[Keith, that's the copper gas line running to the hot water heater, and
the conduit for the electricity. You remember?!\]

Here's where it ends in the back yard. It drains into a hole filled with
gravel.
