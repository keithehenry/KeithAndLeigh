Our best memories of 2023.

*January into March*  
Kibby training - 8 weeks of training, stretching into 12 due to weather, in Camp Verde with Victoria. We earn a certificate ðŸ™‚.

*January*  
Leigh hits the road for a Reiki retreat to Hot Springs, Arkansas - with extra fun crystal mining, "taking the waters," and time with old and new friends.

*February*  
Joseph (Keithâ€™s cousin once removed) visits Sedona. Heavy wet snow puts a damper on our hiking agenda but sure does look pretty. A day-trip to the Grand Canyon puts a nice topper on his short visit.

*March*  
Jill visits for a week plus. We (Leigh mostly) keeps her busy with all the usual hikes, sights, and another quick day-trip to the Grand Canyon. Jill is like a niece to us and a delightful easy guest.

*May*  
Leighâ€™s long awaited week-long retreat in Costa Rica is finally upon us.

Leigh teams up with Gina (from Phoenix) coordinating flights and hotel and tours the capital city of San Juan, including the Gold Museum, the Jade Museum, and the splendid historic National Theater.

The following day, she arrives at The Imiloa Institute retreat center in style, in the overflow transport, a thrilling 4-seater airplane! The retreat center exceeds expectations, with beautiful grounds, comfortable lodging, and delicious all vegan meals.

A fondly remembered highlight is the visit to the Tapir Valley Nature Reserve, only accessible via boat or (extreme) hiking. On the one hour plus boat ride, the group is escorted by dolphins much of the time. At the reserve, she sees monkeys and sloths and other exotic creatures including the elusive *nocturnal* tapir.

Many new friendships are made, and the whole retreat is deemed a smashing success and a wonderful experience. 

*July*  
We combine our interest in camping with an opportunity to visit our friend Samarah in Woodland Park, CO, and set off for adventure. We have a delightful time tent camping for the first time in decades. Later, we meet up with Samarah and our new friends Christina and Fred at their beautiful home in Woodland Park. We enjoy a day at Mueller State Park and dream about spending the cool summers there.

*September*  
We've been planning it for weeks. Time to finally set off on our grand two week road trip adventure to Crater Lake, the Redwoods, Mount Shasta, and more, and even more. We have a fantastic time; a complete success.

*October*  
We've been planning this for even longer. The "ring of fire" annular eclipse on Oct 14th.

We get up at 2AM, out by 4AM, and drive north through Mexican Hat, UT (with my GPS enabled eclipse map) until we just can't get any better - right *smack dab* on the centerline. We cook scrambled eggs, set out a blanket and chairs, and enjoy the show. Too much fun!

*October*  
Several of Leighâ€™s high school friends visit Sedona. Leigh renews old friendships and enjoys showing them some of her favorite spots in Sedona.

*December*  
Leigh's long-time friend Sally and her daughter Trisha visit Sedona. Leigh not only prepares their charts and does astrology readings but doubles as tour guide for four fun days!

Keith and Leigh start pottery classes at the Sedona Arts Center.
