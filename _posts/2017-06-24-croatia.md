it was time for a much needed night's sleep.

***Fri, June 09:***  
Tito's Villa, beautiful Bay of Kotor, and Kotor Town.

After breakfast at the hotel the next morning, we walked through the
[Institute Igalo Spa](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Institute+Igalo/@42.4580043,18.503646,1987m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x0!2zNDLCsDI3JzI4LjIiTiAxOMKwMzAnMjYuNiJF!3b1!8m2!3d42.4578438!4d18.5073891!3m4!1s0x0:0x38d5c1d97fddb1d9!8m2!3d42.4575791!4d18.5090292)
and onward up the slope through the trees to
[Marshal Tito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito)'s
[Villa](http://igalospa.com/en/additional-offer/titos-villa-galeb/).
A local guide gave an informative tour of the site.

Tito was a very important figure in Yugoslavian history before its
breakup in 1991. The information provided by our guide as well as Alan,
our trip leader, gave us a good appreciation of this well-liked,
possibly loved, dictator.

Later that morning, we transported by coach around the beautiful Bay of
Kotor.

We then hopped on a passenger ferry to visit [Our Lady of the
Rocks](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Our+Lady+of+the+Rocks/@42.4655507,18.5743013,22997m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x0!2zNDLCsDI5JzEwLjIiTiAxOMKwNDEnMjIuMiJF!3b1!8m2!3d42.4861641!4d18.6895103!3m4!1s0x0:0x756493b25f441875!8m2!3d42.4867083!4d18.6888204),
an island within the bay.

Later, we explored Kotor Town, the Maritime Museum, a church or two,
with a delicious lunch on our own.

Back at the hotel, we had a swim before dinner, and a walk under the
full moon afterward.

***Sat, June 10:***  
Old Town, Dubrovnik, and boarding the Casanova.

We checked out of the hotel and headed back across the border, with its
associated delay, into Old Town, Dubrovnik.

We met our local guide who showed us around this bustling city.

After our group lunch, Leigh and I took the cable car for some splendid
views of the walled Old Town and coastline.

That evening, we settled into our new home on the
[Casanova](http://www.cruise.croatia-istria.com/ship/88/), had our first
meal on board, and enjoyed a terrific sunset.

Then we went out in search of soap :), came back, and slept...

***Sun, June 11:***  
Morning in Dubrovnik, then depart on our voyage and evening in Šipan.

Sunday morning we bused back into Dubrovnik for time on our own to walk
around the top of the city walls.

Then back to the ship for an informative and entertaining lecture about
the history of the Republic of Ragusa in the Middle Ages. 

During lunch, the Casanova set off on our island-hopping adventure.
After a little swim time from the back of the boat mid-afternoon, we
docked for the night on the quaint island of Šipan.

After dinner, we strolled along the shoreline exploring the small town
and enjoying the sunset views.

***Mon, June 12:***  
A busy day with two islands and sightseeing tours.

We sailed out early in the morning and arrived in Pomena on the island
of Mljet around 9 AM where we met our local guide. We proceed along the
path and down the stone steps of the Mljet National Park where we walked
along the Small Lake.

[![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_20170612_095054993.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_20170612_095054993.jpg)

We then met a passenger ferry which transported us across the Great Lake
to the tiny island within an island where we toured a Benedictine
monastery and the Church of St. Mary and walked the path around the
perimeter. 

[![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_20170612_103810705.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_20170612_103810705.jpg)

We returned via the same route. Mljet island was very quiet, probably a
great place to get away from it all with hiking, bicycling, swimming,
snorkeling, etc., and little else.

After lunch, we arrived in "Medieval" Korčula around 2 PM for our next
guided tour.

[![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_20170612_142116756.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_20170612_142116756.jpg)

We had a splendid tour of the city including the Town Museum and St.
Mark’s Cathedral.

After swimming in the Adriatic on a pebbly beach, we had pizza on our
own at a seaside restaurant.

***Tue, June 13:***  
Lecture on board and sightseeing in Hvar Town.

After breakfast, we enjoyed beautiful scenery as we motored along the
island of Hvar.

Mid-morning, our group leader Alan gave a very informative presentation
on the Yugoslav wars. Serving in the army as war broke out, and lucky to
get out alive, he provided an interesting and unique perspective on this
difficult time.

Afterward, before lunch, we had a quick swim break from the back of the
ship.

[![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20170613_124452_001.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20170613_124452_001.jpg)


In the afternoon, we docked in Hvar Town and started our tour.

Cathedrals, monasteries, public squares and museums *do* tend to blend
after a while but touring this ancient Roman Empire era city was
fascinating nevertheless.

Afterward, we found a restful spot on the main promenade to enjoy a cold
drink or two.

After dinner, we climbed up the hill to the fort for a splendid view.

Notice the ships stacked thirteen across. Ours was the second in line.
(This made for a restless evening for some fellow passengers in the
upper cabins as late night partyers crossed through onto their
respective ships.)


***Wed, June 14:***  
Stari Grad (Hvar Island), on-board lecture, and Klapa singers.

The day started with an early departure and our customary breakfast
buffet.

[![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_20170614_075611722.jpg)]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/IMG_20170614_075611722.jpg)

Does this guy look like the captain of a ship?

Stari Grad had a nice feel to it. We toured the main streets,
monasteries, and museums, of course, then said a special thanks and
goodbye to our guide.

Late afternoon, Alan gave a sequel to his lecture about the Yugoslav
war, emphasizing current relations between peoples and governments of
the former Yugoslavia.

After a short break, we were treated to a splendid performance of
traditional Klapa music.

Trogir, on-board lecture, and dinner with Karen and Mike.

It rained overnight and into the morning as we arrived in Trogir around
11:30 AM.

Alan announced my birthday at lunch. There was a rousing chorus of Happy
Birthday and the best desert (chocolate cake) of the trip.

*Leigh has a photo somewhere.*

Although threatening showers, the weather cleared by the afternoon. Alan
introduced our local guide who led us around the highlights of this 4000
year old city.

there, we saw Karen and Mike and invited them to have dinner with us.

Late afternoon, a University of Split professor gave a presentation on
the Dalmatian economy. Sadly, I barely remember it. 

Although recommended by both Alan and our guide, the restaurant we chose
had only mediocre food. Karen and Mike's company was **outstanding**
however and made dinner on my birthday memorable. Afterward, we paid a
small admission fee and climbed the tower of an old fort for splendid
views of the city.

Split, free time, lecture, farewell captain's dinner.



This morning's guided tour of Split focused on the grand

It was pretty hot to do much sightseeing after lunch so we went
swimming.

Late afternoon, a University of Split professor gave an interesting
presentation on some of her research regarding the 20th-century
sculptor, Ivan Meštrović. We enjoyed it. We later spent hours at his
gallery in Split.

Our last dinner on board was accompanied by a singing duo. They were
quite entertaining with lots of oldies but goodies and singalongs.

That evening we packed up our belongings for leaving the Casanova in the
morning.



***Sat, June 17:***  
Motor-coach to Šibenik, tour of restored country home, and check-in at
the Cornaro Hotel.

In the morning, we said goodbye to the Casanova and loaded a bus for a
two hour scenic drive along the coast to the town of Šibenik. The
coastline was stunningly beautiful. It is said that Bill Gates visits
some of the ports from time to time.

We had our usual guided tour of the town. Unfortunately, the details and
history of Šibenik elude me. Afterward, several of us climbed a few
steps to enjoy a formal garden. (Here's a cool

Afterward, we were bused to a remote country village for hospitality and
lunch at a (rather contrived) country home of years past. The
countryside was interesting though.

That evening, we checked-in to the [Cornaro
Hotel](http://www.cornarohotel.com/). The accommodations were quite nice
and the rooms spacious, especially after being in the smallish cabins
all week.

After our luggage arrived, we freshened up and headed out to
Diocletian’s Palace for a photo of one of the three remaining
3500-year-old granite Egyptian sphinxes.

Dinner at the hotel seemed exceedingly plentiful after a week of rather
petite meal portions on board the Casanova.


***Sun, June 18:***  
Split Ethnographic Museum, Meštrović Gallery, last group dinner.

The breakfast buffet at the Cornaro was outstanding. I'd stay there
again just for the buffet.

Afterward, our group walked over to the Ethnographic Museum where the
curator gave an informative slide presentation. Afterward we toured the
museum at leisure. It was quite well presented and enjoyable.

Afterward, on our free time and last full day in Croatia, we walked
along the port and fifteen minutes further to the Meštrović Gallery.

The gallery was superb and well worth the visit. An audio-tour,
available free with admission on your smartphone or tablet, helped call
attention to detail and further appreciation of his fine work.

That evening, our Road Scholar group had our last dinner together at an
outdoor restaurant off the plaza in Split.



***Mon, June 19:***  
Long, tiresome travel back home.

All but three of us bused together to the airport at 5 AM.

Depart 19 June 07:55 AM Split  
Arrive 19 June 09:35 AM Munich  
Depart 19 June 12:00 PM Munich  
Arrive 19 June 03:15 PM Los Angeles  
Depart 19 June 07:25 PM Los Angeles  
Arrive 19 June 09:00 PM Phoenix  

We stayed overnight at the airport hotel where we had parked the car.
Including the nine hour time difference, delays into Phoenix, and
transport to the hotel, it made for a twenty-eight hour travel day. Too
long.


***Tue, June 20:***  
Back home by around noon. Pets fine. Mission accomplished!
