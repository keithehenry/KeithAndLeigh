Our days have been spent settling in. As I'm sure you can imagine, there
are many details involved with an international move. Keith has done a
super job seeing to all the details!

We want to explore our area a bit but haven't wanted to go too far as
we've had a brake leak for over a month. We keep adding brake fluid
every other day or so. We finally received parts from the US on Monday
and the car is in the shop as I write. When we are confident that all is
well with our vehicle, I think we'll make plans to at least take some
day trips. We want to get to the beach before it gets too hot, but want
to avoid the Easter holidays, as it's a big family vacation period here
in Mexico.
