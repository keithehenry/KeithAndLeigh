It's been cloudy and rainy in sunny Mexico the last couple of weeks -
ever since we returned home from our visit to Quito, Ecuador and the
Galapagos Islands. So I'm blaming the weather for my lack of energy and
for not blogging about the trip yet.

However, we have sorted through the Galapagos photos, and have
identified the seventy-some
[Best of Galapagos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/jJQnscGa1cgTRXCaA).
You can select the slideshow option,
or step through manually with the right and left arrows if you like.

Of course, I hope to someday have a Quito slideshow and a lot more
narrative but, well, it's really cloudy...
