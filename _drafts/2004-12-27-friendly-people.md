We have met some very nice people here; everyone is very friendly and
welcoming. I think partly because they remember what it was like to be
new in a foreign land, no matter how many years it has been. People we
meet from NH or MA are instantly interested in chatting with us (as we
are with them) and we are a curiosity to some because of our youth. We
have become less shy about meeting people and actually waited outside of
the market for the owner of a car with MA plates so we could ask some
questions regarding logistics with registration requirements! He was an
Irishman from Watertown, if my memory serves me.
