This is a great easy hike only minutes away - a nice step-up from a
morning's walk around the neighborhood.

Also hiked:  
Several times, prior to logging.  
2015-11-06 - With gentle snowfall; very nice.  
[2015-12-24](https://goo.gl/photos/BvLMc3mBf6FYvkg4A) - Mid-40s and
overcast but always pleasant.  
2016-01-21 - Same hike, opposite direction.
