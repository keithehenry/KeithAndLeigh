We are online at home now! We have DSL (high speed Internet over the
phone line). It is about four times faster then we had in Tyngsboro.
Well, to be fair, it costs more than four times as much too. I think
it's funny that I have to go to Mexico to get high speed Internet :)

Leigh is actually in Las Vegas at this moment. She's attending the AEA
board meeting and conference again this year. She is scheduled to return
on Sunday.

Regarding not having a car: it is not really a problem yet. Our house is
one block from the highway with bus service every 20 minutes or so. A
grocery store and a few restaurants are within walking distance if we
don't want to hop the bus. I reserved two seats on the Wal Mart / Costco
/ Sam's Club bus for next Wednesday. They bill it as "Shop till you
drop". Leigh got a taxi to the Guadalajara airport for $230 pesos, about
$21 USD. People have volunteered to give us rides occasionally too.

I've attached a FAQ that I'm working on. I'm afraid it has zapped all my
energy for this evening. Well, the ergonomics of this desk and laptop
setup might have something to do with it. Anyway, I thought you might
like to look at it - bear in mind that it is a work in progress.

Fill us in on what's happening up north.

Love,

Keith
