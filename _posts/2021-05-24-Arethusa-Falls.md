We finally got out for a real hike in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. 

Here's Leigh at the trailhead for Arethusa Falls:

The trail was shaded but rocky, with a nice mix of deciduous and evergreens.

With a couple lovely wooden bridges:

And here's *the* Arethusa Falls, considered the tallest waterfall in NH, at approximately 140 ft.:

This was a relatively difficult hike for us after many days of inactivity. It was only 2.75 miles but approximately 1000 ft of elevation gain. We took our time and enjoyed a lunch at the falls, spending almost 3.5 hours total.

And wait! There's even a video. Enjoy!
