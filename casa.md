introduction: |
    In December of 2005, we purchased *La Casa de Don Manuel*, a neglected house in the
    community of *Vista del Lago*, near Lake Chapala in Jalisco, Mexico.

    This is a revamped version of an old blog I maintained for a few years chronicling
    our efforts to make the never-lived-in Mexican country house our home.
