Welcome to our neighborhood of *Vista del Lago*. This is the turn-in
about four miles east of *Chapala* off the road to *Mezcala*.

About a hundred yards in you are greeted by the ever-present and
friendly guards at the local police house. Although everyone is free to
enter or exit, the guards do give some reassurance that all your
household goods won't leave the neighborhood unexpectedly.

You follow the cobblestone drive gently up the hill enjoying the scenery
on your way to the Country Club clubhouse.

You stop in at the clubhouse and look around at the golf course. Looks
nice!

Back at the parking lot, you look up the hill and get a sense for how
the houses sit on the hillside.

Eventually, all the way up the hill, around to the right, and further
up, you come to our front gate.

You peek in and see some of our landscaping. Interesting...
