Here are photos of the original "camp kitchen".

Off frame, to the right is a small dorm-size refrigerator. To the left
is a small microwave. Outside on the service patio is the gas grill.

We once thought the kitchen was our top priority but have found it
easier and more satisfying to knock off smaller more manageable jobs
first. For subsistence eaters like us, this kitchen is working for
now.

How do you like the creative use of the cardboard packing boxes?
