We started North Wilson Mountain trail from the Encinoso Picnic Area in
late August but were short on water and a couple degrees too warm. In
mid-November, the temperatures were much more suitable.

This is a somewhat difficult trail so we only hiked in and up about a
mile then turned around. It was surprisingly cool for a while in a shady
section. For us frankly, the best views were very near the beginning.
See the video for August 30th.  
  
We did have some nice Fall foliage that day...
