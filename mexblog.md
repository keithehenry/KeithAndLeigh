sub_title: "Our Adventure of Moving to Lake Chapala"
introduction: |
    In 2004, we moved to a large ex-pat community on the shores of Lake Chapala in Jalisco, Mexico.
    It was a great adventure, and we had a terrific run - more than ten years total!
    
    But it was no longer the same after our community was terrorized in the spring of 2012.
    Our hearts sank. The fun dissipated.
    We finished renovations, sold our home, and returned to the USA in 2015.

    > Blog entries prior to May 2005 are reworked snippets of old emails that have never been fully adapted to the blog format. There is way too much duplication, too many personal references, and too much trivia to be worth reading. But it's not worth the effort to fix either. :) My apologies.
