We had a good trip, fairly uneventful and smooth going. We made a few
stops for some fun along the way to break up the drive; we were on the
road for 9 days. It's good to be back! Lakeside feels like home after
being gone for 3 weeks and on the road for such a long time. Things are
more familiar than when we first came - getting around is now easier
with the car and we kind of know where we are going.

We are trying to settle ourselves back in... There is much Christmas
activity here now, concerts, house tours and the like - 'though we are
in a bit of a time-warp without our familiar traditions, weather-cues
and such, we are keeping busy experiencing all the new and different
things here. This is a happening place and it's amazing how quickly the
days disappear. The weather is nearly perfect and it's very pretty in
many places. The challenges of daily living kept us very busy for the
six weeks before our trip! We met some very nice people immediately.
Other foreigners are very friendly and there is a bond that stems from
being a newcomer in a foreign land, no matter how long they've been
here, they still remember. Of course, we are a little younger than most
ex-pats, so we are a curiosity to some! Everyone here has a story and
most are more than happy to tell it...
