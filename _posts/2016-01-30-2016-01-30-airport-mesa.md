We checked out Airport Mesa with the idea of bringing visitors for an
easy hike.

Unfortunately, when the small parking lot is full, the
additional 0.6 miles (one way) from the large lot to get to the main
trail makes it much less attractive. It's pretty steep going back uphill
too.  
  
The east and south sides of the loop are nice though. We walked around
the entire way once before and didn't think the second two-thirds worth
the trouble though.  
  
With the storm coming in, the air was oddly hazy.
