Well, after that slight glitch the other night that so rudely ended our
conversation, I think things are back to normal here (computer-wise)
except that we can't talk to your phone through our computer any more.
Not a strong enough signal or fast enough connection or something like
that.

We are told that there is a chance that DSL will be avail. in our
neighborhood within a few months. We'll see... Actually 4 people do have
it, but we're told that they need more lines or something and there's a
bit of bureaucracy here in Mexico so there's been a hold-up for quite
some time from what I gather. DSL would make this rental just about
perfect. Except for the dogs barking...man there is no escaping them!!
Last night for a few minutes there was silence, it was so unusual, it
caught my attention! I heard the silence!
