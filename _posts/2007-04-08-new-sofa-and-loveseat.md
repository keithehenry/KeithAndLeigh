Here's a photo of our new sofa and loveseat.

The inspiration for these colors was from a large ceramic plate and
matching vase that Leigh found at an "end of season" sale.

In turn, the paint colors for the walls in the living and dining rooms
were based on these. There's even a little bit of teal in the fabric to
match the accent tiles.
