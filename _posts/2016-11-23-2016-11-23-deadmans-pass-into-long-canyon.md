We chose Deadman's Pass for a new trail to try for the day before
Thanksgiving.

The weather was perfect for hiking with a high of around
60 F and sunny. Deadman's Pass was a nice easy hike with excellent views, especially to
the left toward Boynton Canyon. The trail is short though, at only about
1.2 miles, so we continued on into Long Canyon. (We had been on this
section before, but had approached it from a different trailhead.) We
hiked about another 1.3 miles. It was quite pleasant as it meandered
through the canyon along a wash.  
  
Round trip was only 5 miles but we spent a leisurely 4 hours enjoying
ourselves. A good time was had by all.
