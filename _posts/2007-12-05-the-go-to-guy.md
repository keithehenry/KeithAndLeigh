A classic photo of our no job too big, too small, or too dirty, go-to
guy, Chuy:

The past two and a half months have seen a firestorm of activity as
Chuy, Ricardo, and Nicol√°s complete another series of some 30+ projects.
With a 46 hour work week, every morning at 8:30, excluding Sundays, it's
great to have them here, but even better now that they're gone.

Painting the entire outside of the house, cleaning and sealing the
brick, and refurbishing the front doors and all remaining windows would
have to be considered the main event. But it's all the little details
and side projects along the way that have made the big difference. At
this point, with the exception of the woodwork refinishing, the kitchen,
and laundry room, the bulk of the house is in great shape. (Well, OK,
there might be a few other things...)

Here's a photo of the new and improved exterior, front and rear:

We've received many compliments on the near-monochrome "brick"
color-scheme. We're quite pleased too.

We still have the kitchen and laundry room rework, car port, outdoor
living areas and landscaping. But for right now, it's great to have the
place back to ourselves for a while...
