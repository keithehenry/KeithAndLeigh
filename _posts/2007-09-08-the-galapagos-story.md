We enjoyed our brief visit to the Galapagos Islands. We're glad we went.
For us though, it wasn't money well spent.

I can't really recommend going. At least not if you're just a tourist,
like we were. Maybe if you are a true naturalist who has read and
studied about the islands forever and just have to see red-footed
boobies, well OK. But in that case, plan ahead, hire the best
level-three naturalist you can find, hope that your itinerary and guide
aren't changed on you at the last minute, don't go during the summer,
and expect to spend a lot of money.

We're not naturalists. We didn't plan ahead. We were in a group, with an
itinerary chosen by a travel agent. We were there in high season, not
because it is the best time to go, but because it's summer vacation,
because, well, we were going to be in Ecuador anyway... The truth is, we
didn't put any energy into planning the trip and got out about equal to
what we put in. Well, almost. The trip was too expensive for the value
received.

The problem is that the mystique of "The Galapagos Islands" creates a
huge demand for tourism (from people like us who don't even really know
what they're looking at). So tour operators and guides fill the demand,
even if capacity is exceeded. The resulting experience can be
disappointing, as ours was.

Although I joked about it before going, I think maybe we should have
just rented the DVD. I'll bet you National Geographic's photos are
better than ours. And maybe they saw the pelicans!

But you could say that about almost anywhere right? I think I'll just
watch it on TV next time...
