The floors on the main level have been a real roller-coaster ride.

The grout has gone from a dingy gray, to reddish-brown, to a attractive
glossy "coco-brown". Unfortunately, now, in one or two areas, the glossy
sealant is flaking off. We don't really know why.

So the floors look great compared to when we bought the place, but
sometimes not quite as perfect as we'd like.

Leigh has worked incredibly hard on them...

Bringing the color back to the grout with wire brush and acid:

Painstakingly applying multiple coats of sealant:

What a job!

Taking a break:
