We had a great visit with my sister Kathy and step-mother Florence
(Peanuts) in early March. We held to a slower pace with these two
compared to Holly and Andy's visit.

We went to many of the same restaurants but also Jose's Illusion, a Greek
restaurant, and The Secret Garden, with friends Rick and Kay.

We looked around Chapala a bit. Stopped into a church and walked out
onto the pier. We saw the grounds of the Lake Chapala Society. There
were lots of people there in early March. On our last full day we
enjoyed a ride along the north side of the lake and around to the west -
a good opportunity to see some of the countryside.

Kathy, Leigh, and Keith enjoyed a few morning walks around the golf
course and hikes into the nearby hills. We all enjoyed another
production at the Lakeside Little Theatre, the musical Cabaret.

Of course, we toured our new house one day:

The time flew by. I remember a little cribbage playing and movie
watching at home too but not much else. (It's late June as I write this.)
But best of all - nobody got sick from the food or drink - always a
concern when entertaining in Mexico :).

Thanks for your visit! We had a great time.
