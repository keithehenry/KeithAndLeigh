We hiked the Courthouse Butte Loop starting at the Bell Rock Vista
parking area and circling counter-clockwise.

We found the last stretch
from Baby Bell back to the parking area quite boring. The scenery and
road noise just aren't up to par. I guess we're spoiled. :)

Next time we would park at the Courthouse Vista parking area, circle
clockwise, and turn around at our favorite spot at the intersection of
Courthouse Butte and Big Park loop.  
  
The phone wasn't charged that day so there are no photos, etc.
