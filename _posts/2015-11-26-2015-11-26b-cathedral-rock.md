Thanksgiving Day, Part II -

After leaving the caves we decided to check
for an opening at the parking lot for Cathedral Rock. There were two! It
was quite busy climbing straight up so we decided to check out the
Easybreezy Trail. It wasn't long before it looped around and connected
with the Templeton Trail. We had done the other end of Templeton a few
weeks ago. We continued hiking until we met up with the end of our
previous hike, then back again to the car via the more direct Cathedral
Rock Trail. Superb scenery!
