Up the ridge to the "V" and around to the right to Castle Rock saddle.

(Keith and Cobre sniffed out this trail while Leigh was in NE.) There
were a lots of ups and downs; the final stretch to sit on the saddle
looked like a bit much for Cobre, so we didn't go. Almost though :).  
  
The hike up to the "V" is super, and far enough, with great views of
Cathedral Rock along the way.  
  
Also hiked:  
2015-10-13 - Up to the ledge above the "V".
