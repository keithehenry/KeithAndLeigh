Our days have recently been spent looking for housing. We are still
unsure if we will buy or rent. Our minds change daily! At this very
moment, we are more actively seeking a nice rental that will accept our
pets. The problem has been that the really nice places don't want (or
have to because the market is tight) to accept pets. Can't say as I
blame them, but it makes it more difficult for us. We were networking at
church today and I have a couple leads. We'll see. We don't have to
leave this place, but we'd like to! We need to give notice by the end of
this month if we'd like to leave at the end of March, so we're heating
up the search.

Real estate housing prices are rising quickly and most of the inventory
has sold, so pickin's are slim and if a house hasn't sold, it may be
because the owners want too much or something else is wrong. We just
started exploring east of the town of Chapala. Most of the "community"
is west of Chapala, where we live now. East there is more space and less
Americanization, both of which appeal to us. I have faith that we'll
find suitable accommodations one way or the other.

The climate here is most agreeable and I'm not sure about other areas
which might be less "discovered" and have better housing values. I think
there is a reason so many people have settled here. Keith wants to
explore with the idea of maybe finding a better spot to relocate to, but
I'm not as gung-ho, as I think the perfect climate here doesn't extend
too far. As far as not as much humidity, not being too cold in the
winter and too hot in the summer. The lake moderates the temps. here and
that's just great!
