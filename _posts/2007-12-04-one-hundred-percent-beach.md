We finally took an opportunity to get away to the beach over the
weekend.

A short distance south of Colima on the Pacific ocean is the small town
of San Juan de Alima. We had a small room there for two nights right on
the ocean. It was very very basic, not even any hot water in the shower,
but it was only $200 pesos (about $20 USD) a night. And truthfully, the
weather in December was still plenty hot and steamy enough!

We call it 100% beach because that was about all there was, a few
family-owned hotels and restaurants, but that's it. We read, played
cards, and walked a lot. The beach was great for playing in the ocean,
gentle waves and water that was refreshing but not too cold! It was a
great escape.

Unfortunately, even though it was fairly easy to get to, it was still
about a five hour drive. We're going to see what else we can find in
about the same driving time using a different route. This might be the
winter we spend in search of the perfect quick beach get-away...
