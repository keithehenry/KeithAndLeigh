Today my day didn't start off too well. I got my first scorpion sting.
Not a pleasant experience, but I'm o.k. and I'm pretty sure I'm going to
live! We only had one at our other house, and it didn't cause much
consternation.

We have been here less than 2 weeks and have seen 2....My symptoms are
normal as near as I can tell, but I don't like them. I read that you're
not supposed to eat anything for 24 hours, but I was hungry so I tried
to have a snack. The reason you're not supposed to eat anything is that
your throat closes a bit and it's hard to swallow! I just tried drinking
and it's not easy either. All else is fine, just some tingling and the
spot where I got stung is sore and has spikes of pain.
