I have my DSL modem in hand! It will be a couple days until the system
is turned on. I did have to wait at Telmex another two hours, but
considering they only had one wireless modem available that day and I
got it I feel it was a major success.

Well, we are living here now, so not every day is great. But we found a
Yoga class that meets three times a week (and it's free!) that is good.
We also found the nearby Little Chapel with a built-in set of church
people to get to know. \[These are both in English of course.\]

We went out to eat last night at a place that has live entertainment
every night. The band wasn't great but everyone was dancing and having a
good time. So it was fun.

We went to the local community theater a couple nights ago. The play was
hard to follow although the actors did a pretty good job. I'm expecting
a little bit better - but then again it is *community* theater...

We both like our haircuts. Leigh is going back to the same place for a
manicure and pedicure.

The stove is propane and probably works but it is the buying the
ingredients that we have little time for. And the restarants are
reasonably priced. It is something we have to work on...

Love you guys,

Keith
