Just a quick note to let you know we arrived safely and are settling in
nicely. Kitties did really well and are nearly back to normal. Our plan
for immediate internet access did not work, hence the delay in touching
base. We found an internet cafe and wanted to let you know all is well.
Our house is very nice but we have been busy cleaning it. It has been
closed up for many months. Sorry we could not visit very well when we
last saw you, we were really under the gun. We did not finish up totally
until 11:30ish the night before we had to be at the airport at 4:30 am!
Our pace is much more leisurely now!

Love to you both.

Leigh and Keith, Bella and Thomas
