We enjoyed a new hike, the Turkey Creek Trail, on Easter Sunday.

We went as far as the "tank" (a depression where water might collect), had a
long break, and returned via the same route. It was plenty warm but
thankfully there was a pleasant breeze now and then. We were pretty dry
and dusty by the time we returned at 1 PM though.  
  
There are some great views from a high point, only about a half a mile
in. Very nice.
