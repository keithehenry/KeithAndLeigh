It was a beautiful sunny day so we decided to check out the Adobe Jack
Trail for the first time.

It started out a bit breezy but this trail
became nicely sheltered as we got further along. The first section was
also also exposed to a bit of road noise. Nice trail, but not one of our
favorites. A good wintertime trail.
