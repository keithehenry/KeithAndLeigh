Our household goods have finally arrived. It had been just about four
weeks since we packed them up in a freight truck heading to Mexico.

The truck actually made it to the border in about two and a half weeks.
But then it took a while for the customs broker to get the paperwork in
order and get a place in line. Then a couple more days waiting. Finally,
more than a week later, it was here, over the border.

We got the dreaded "red light" - meaning that our shipment was actually
opened and inspected by the customs officials. We didn't have any
problems though. Apparently our thorough documentation paid off.
Luckily, they didn't find the boxes of Leigh's favorite tea or the
lifetime supply of relish (new / unopened items) that we smuggled in!

Delivery day was tense. We expected the truck at 10 AM. At 10:05 Eduardo
(our local mover) called and said there would be a delay - no driver in
Guadalajara. We were assured the truck would arrive that day. We just
didn't know when.

Here I am, anxiously waiting:

I eat when I'm stressed. So I'm just headed out to get some lunch when
here comes the truck!

When the truck is opened, it's clear that the bulkhead is no longer in
place as we left it, reinforcing the idea that it's been inspected by
Customs. It's also clear that the contents has shifted. This is not
good! I don't know whose responsibility it was to pack it up tight again - maybe
our Customs broker? This seems to be an unavoidable wildcard in the process.

Eduardo and his crew unloaded everything with us giving directions as
best we could. Everything that was unmarked just went into the living
room:

By the following day, things are already getting set up. Here's our
dining room:

And our living room:

There are lots of "bruises" but most everything survived the journey
intact. We're glad we don't have to buy all new furniture - we like the
stuff we have.

We set up the bedroom over the course of the weekend. Everything fit
better than expected. We slept overnight for the first time Sunday
Memorial Day weekend.
