We really enjoyed our visit to Pátzcuaro. It was especially fun to go
with our friends Barb, from North of the border, and Debbie and Brad,
from Lakeside.

Take a look at our thirty-one
[Best of Pátzcuaro](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5uqjJ2EchcXfhrma8)
photo album.

Hint: There are captions if you can find them.
Try viewing one at a time and moving the mouse a little.
Keyboard arrow keys allow you to go at your own pace.

Enjoy!
