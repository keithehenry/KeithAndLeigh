I just had to take a picture to remind myself of the hours and hours I
spent repairing and cleaning toilets.

After first shopping around locally, we decided on and bought new
matching wooden seats at Home Depot. Then I looked at each toilet in
detail, checking the water level, fixing leaks, replacing and cleaning
valves, adjusting the flow, etc. I even had to look up how they worked
on the Internet just to make sure I was getting everything just right.

What a great invention!

It took me a little while to figure out why some new parts didn't fit
the old. Turns out everything is connected with flexible hoses these
days - a different size than the original hardware. I need to replace
the shut-off valve and supply pipe to get everything back together with
the new scheme.

Once I got one working perfectly I cleaned it top to bottom. The bowls
had rather severe mineral deposits. I used CLR, muriatic acid, and some
special sandpaper made for use with water. Once everything was good, the
new toilet seat was installed and I moved onto the next one.

I'm pleased to report that all four toilets are now up and running!
