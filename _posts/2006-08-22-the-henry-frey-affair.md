I'd been so preoccupied with my projects around the house that I almost
missed the biggest Henry family social event in decades - The Henry /
Frey affair!

Yes it's true. With only about two weeks to go, Leigh and I switched
gears and planned a trip north for my niece Colleen's and Tom's wedding
in Lebanon, PA.

Of course the wedding was the main event. But while in the area, we
realized we could easily spend two weeks touring Amish Country,
Gettysburg, the Shenandoah Valley and Blue Ridge Parkway, and possibly
Washington, D.C. I also hoped maybe we could circle back around and
visit one or both of my brothers at their homes as well.

The trip went off without a hitch (July 28th through August 15th). We
had a great time. It was especially great seeing everyone. I think it
had been more than a decade since we were all together in one place. We
fit everything in except Washington, D.C. We'll have to do that at
another time.

Here are a few photos from the wedding reception.
