We have driven to Guadalajara twice recently. The second trip was easier
than the first, but both went well. I pray before going and won't
consider going into the city without doing so!

We have a couple good maps now (part of the problem with the first trip
was that we had to go into the city to buy the map and it took us a very
long time to find our way!) When we finally found where we wanted to be
we felt very victorious, but it wasn't until we made it safely back home
that we knew we had been victorious.

At one point we found ourselves in a four, maybe five lane rotary. I
missed the road we needed to take to get off and as we were driving
around again, I noticed there were traffic lights within the rotary! I
hadn't even seen them the first time around. It was the most frightening
round-about I've ever experienced.

We ventured out less than a week later to find a Wal-Mart for some
household things. It too was a successful trip. No mishaps, no hassles
by the city police, which we hear is a very real likelihood when you are
driving a foreign-plated car. I ask for my angels to guide us and
protect us and so far they have! We had a near-miss that Keith said was
a miracle that nothing happened on our first trip - that's how I know my
prayers were answered.

The city is very intimidating, but we are learning the best way in and
how to get around a little. It's like Boston, if you've never driven
there and don't have a map it would be just as scary, except you don't
have to worry about the police unless you break the law. Here it doesn't
matter...

Happily, here at Lakeside the cops are not a problem for the most part.
I'm not nervous driving around here at all - I just don't like the
cobblestone streets!
