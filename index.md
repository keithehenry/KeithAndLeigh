introduction: |
    In 2004, we moved to a large ex-pat community on the shores of Lake Chapala in Jalisco, Mexico.
    It was a great adventure, and we had a terrific run - more than ten years total!
    
    But it was no longer the same after our community was terrorized in the spring of 2012.
    Our hearts sank. The fun dissipated.
    We finished renovations, sold our home, and returned to the USA in 2015.

# 1600 x 600 is a good middle-ground size to aim for:
