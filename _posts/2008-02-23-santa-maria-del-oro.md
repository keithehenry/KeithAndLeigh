Late in January, we went for an overnight to La Laguna (aka Crater Lake)
just outside of Santa María del Oro, about three and a half hour's drive
from Chapala.

This spot was recommended by our chiropractor as a nice get-away. We
also found it mentioned in one of our local guide books. Apparently, the
lake is formed in the crater of an extinct volcano. With a goal of
trying to work in a bit more sightseeing, and its close proximity to
home, this destination fit the bill for January.

Our first stop along the way was the town of Magdalena. This town is
known for its opal mining. We stopped in to look at a couple of the
shops, but mainly, it was a good place to stop for lunch. The town had a
good feel to it and seemed to be thriving. Here's a photo of the main
plaza:

After lunch, we made it to our destination, Santa María del Oro.
Zig-zagging through town, we eventually got to the lookout over Crater
Lake:

There's a 5-star resort on the far side of the lake, where we enjoyed a
nice dinner our first evening. It was very pretty, and seemingly
deserted mid-week. The rooms were pricey at over $100 USD a night; but
it might easily be worth it for a special occasion.

We chose the more cost-effective bungalows at the RV park / campground.
They were more than adequate. We had a beautiful view of the lake.
Here's a photo taken around 8 AM while enjoying our morning coffee:

Later that morning we did a little more exploring, then sampled the
luncheon fare at one of the many lakeside restaurants. We tried the
local specialty, *chicharones de pescado*. Unfortunately, it seemed to be
mostly deep-fry, and very little fish. (OK, so it was totally inedible.)
Luckily, we had ordered some *quesadillas* too. The ambiance and the views
were great though:

We topped it all off with an ice-cream bar and then headed back home.

And that's the story of our quick little gotta-see-some-sights getaway
for January...
