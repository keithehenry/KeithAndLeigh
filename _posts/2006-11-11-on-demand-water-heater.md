Here is the on-demand water heater that I managed to install myself.

I bought it at the Home Depot in Guadalajara along with the kit of hoses
and valves and a section of copper tubing. I already had the torch and
other supplies from a previous plumbing job on the roof.

After some initial disappointment, we're very happy with it now. I have
yet to try filling the tub with it though.

I wish I had the "before photo" but I don't. We managed to limp along
with the old heater for about six months. It was quite the eye-sore and
about ready to rust out entirely at any moment.
